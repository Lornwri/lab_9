The solutions I used in the first version of this assignment seems almost more cluttered than the Vue version. Everything is clearer cut with regards to what is occurring in the code, but everything also seems to take more commands to make happen compared to Vue that allows for the use of Vue commands that simplify the same instructions. This can be seen primarily in the script sections of both assignments where the vanilla JavaScript has a long list of ‘let’ variables to accomplish what fewer ‘const’ commands achieve in Vue.

I prefer Vue.js on those grounds as I find that the few steps needed to be taken helps to keep a project from becoming overwhelmed and bloated with code that even the developers can’t understand properly. I also prefer it due to the use of the return function that allows me to see what command methods have been used throughout my code – I use this almost like a checklist to ensure I have everything I need to make the app run appropriately. I also prefer its use with regards to Developer Tools online because the look is much more clearer and easier to follow for error reporting.
